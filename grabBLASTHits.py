'''Make sure that the BLAST result file, the database fasta file, and the 
BLASTHits.py file are all in the same directory. 

To run this in a unix environment move into the working directory containing 
your sequence list, the assembly file in fasta format, and the 
grabBLASTHits.py program. Then type the following:
    
    python grabBLASTHits.py <fastaFile> <hitFile> numHits

Where the <fastaFile> is the name of your database fasta file, the <hitFile> is 
the name of your BLAST result file, and numHits is the number of hits that you 
wish to extract from the database (if no number is included for this option, 
all hits will be extracted).

To run this in a python environment, start python, and type:
    
    import grabBLASTHits
    grabBLASTHits.makeFastaFile(<fastaFile>,<textFile>,numHits)
    
***Note: You will receive an error when importing this module into python. 
Disregard that error message, the module loaded properly.

input formats. If you would like some help getting it to work, or if you would 
like a program that accepts more flexible inputs, please contact Joel
